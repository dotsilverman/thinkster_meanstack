ngShow and ngHide allow us to display or hide different elements.
This helps when creating Angular apps since our single page applications will
most likely have many moving parts that come and go as the state of our application changes.

<!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->
<div ng-show="myValue"></div>

<a> tag html: it's an anchor element that defines a hyperlink to a location
